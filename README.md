**First Step : Read of file**

When I read the topic, let's identify the most important issues to do this. Let's identify what these actually emphasize.

**Third Step : Analysis**

This is the very difficult part of doing it. Because we need to use our knowledge of C language.
I tried to explain the functions as descriptively as possible.

Before start writing code, you should know how your code works in the system. Because it is important to follow it by reading the file where you are.

I created a simple frame to imagine and understand it!

Now you can check my functions descriptions.
